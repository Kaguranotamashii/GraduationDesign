# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

接下来你需要完成一个react three.js的组件
导入模型public/models/42.glb，这个模型是个古建筑模型，这是我的毕业设计，我有个功能是要求实现点击古建筑对应的部分显示文字档用来介绍这个古建筑部分是什么东西干什么的这种的
但是这种的模型他们是必须要先设计下哪部分是对应着怎么样的文字什么的吧
所以我希望我们的系统分为两大部分
第一部分是能绘制这一部分是什么东西，可以存放到json文件或者其他文件你自己决定
第二部分读取对应的json文件，点击模型对应的部分，然后显示对应的文字档，这个文字档是已经写好的，你只需要调用显示出来就行
